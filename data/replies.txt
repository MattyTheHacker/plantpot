it's one of rose days...
i'm well, you asking me has made my daisy
sorting out my weed issue once and floral
i'm feeling clover the moon!
i'm well, how's it growing?
i was hoping some-bud-y would ask me that
lilac that you asked me that
i'm doing bouquet
i'm feeling dandy, i'm not lion!
feeling a lily better now that you've asked me
a pot better now you're here!
i really seed a break...
feeling a sense of impending bloom...
i'm gladiola you asked
i'm well, thistle be a great day
aloe, i'm doing great
i be-leaf this'll be a great day!
iris-ed you
hiya-cinth, thanks for asking 
i need some encourage-mint
its party thyme
i’m very frond of you
i’m rooting for you
lettuce do our best to have a good day
life would succ without you
pretty fly for a cacti
my fear of roses is a thorny issue
i love you from my head tomatoes
a little bit rad, but not totally. i’m only rad-ish
long thyme no see
re-leaved that spring is here
i need some peas and quiet
im a little sad, i hope you photo-sympathise
i’ve been bamboo-zled
good chives only
i’m all dressed up and nowhere to grow
i’m worried im a one trick peony
i want to start gardening but i haven't botany plants
you’re full of sage advice
i’m a bit nervous, my palms are sweaty
i’m thinking about moving out, i dont have mushroom here
nothing can kale my vibe today
i’m just plant-astic
my day could be better but thistle do
